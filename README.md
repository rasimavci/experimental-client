## Experimental Mobile WebRTC Client with Vuejs and vuex

> An example to build a client with Vue2 and vuex using kandy.js

## Introduction
In this applicaton I tried to build a minimal webRTC client for mobile using kandy.js

After all, I learned Vue for a while, and I tried to be familier more about the Vue ecosystem and after reading some guides in their official site, I just want to try my chance.

So I decided to build this mobile client, please share your comments !
